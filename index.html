                <h3>A web developer in love with JavaScript; a CPA in the past</h3>
                <p>I have always loved solving problems. When I worked as an accountant, I geeked out on creating Excel templates that would save everyone time. Lots of time! To do that, I had to research, Google and peruse StackOverflow for days and weeks. And one day, after doing this for years, I thought, "Heck, that's what I should do for a living!" So, here I am - a bootcamp student conquering JavaScript, SQL, Python, and many more to come. My greatest interests are foreign languages, reading, and cooking to the sound of tech podcasts.</p>
